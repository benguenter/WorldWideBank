# WorldwideBank

Built with:
 - Jetbrains Rider
 - Dotnet 3.1
 - C# 8.0 language features (yay better pattern matching!)
 - MSTest
 
Code Coverage is at 100%.
The project should just run, download and run unit tests to verify logic.

Ideas for future improvement:
 - Transactions for Transfer
 - Include better "rails" type development patterns (i.e. bind/map)
 - More validation for requests
 - Audit Log history of requests
 - Configuration for currency conversion
